# mx_channel_write

## NAME

channel_write - write a message to a channel

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <magenta/syscalls.h>

mx_status_t mx_channel_write(mx_handle_t handle, uint32_t flags,
                             void* bytes, uint32_t num_bytes,
                             mx_handle_t* handles, uint32_t num_handles);
```

## DESCRIPTION

**channel_write**() attempts to write a message of *num_bytes*
bytes and *num_handles* handles to the channel specified by
*handle*.  The pointers *handles* and *bytes* may be NULL if their
respective sizes are zero.

On success, all *num_handles* of the handles in the *handles* array
are no longer accessible to the caller's process -- they are attached
to the message and will become available to the reader of that message
from the opposite end of the channel.  On any failure, all handles
remain accessible to the caller's process and are not transferred.

If the *handle* channel is a reply channel, *handle* must be
included as the last handle in the *handles* array.

If the *handle* channel is not a reply channel, it is invalid
to include *handle* in the *handles* array.

To create a reply channel, use MX_CHANNEL_CREATE_REPLY_CHANNEL in the
**channel_create**() call.

## RETURN VALUE

**channel_write**() returns **NO_ERROR** on success.

## ERRORS

**ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *handle* is not a valid handle or any of *handles*
are not a valid handle.

**ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *handle* is not a channel handle.

**ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *bytes* is an invalid pointer, or *handles*
is an invalid pointer, or if there are duplicates among the handles
in the *handles* array.

**ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED**  *handle* was found in the *handles* array
and the channel is not a reply channel.

**ERR_ACCESS_DENIED**  *handle* does not have **MX_RIGHT_WRITE** or
any of *handles* do not have **MX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**.

**ERR_REMOTE_CLOSED**  The other side of the channel is closed.

**ERR_BAD_STATE**  The channel is a reply channel and the reply channel
handle was not included as the last element of the *handles* array.

**ERR_NO_MEMORY**  (Temporary) Failure due to lack of memory.

**ERR_TOO_BIG**  *num_bytes* or *num_handles* are larger than the
largest allowable size for channel messages.

**ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED**  one of the handles in *handles* was *handle*
(the handle to the channel being written to).

## NOTES

*num_handles* is a count of the number of elements in the *handles*
array, not its size in bytes.
