# FIDL: Compiler Specification

This document describes the front-end interface to the Zircon fidl
host tool.

Information on the internals of that tool lives [alongside the source
of the tool](../../system/host/fidl/README.md).

See [FIDL: Overview](index.md) for more information about FIDL's overall
purpose, goals, and requirements, as well as links to related documents.
