// Cobalt is the Fuchsia service used to log, collect and analyze metrics.
// The two main pillars of Cobalt are protecting user privacy and providing
// high-quality, aggregate metrics to serve system and component software
// developers' needs.
//
// This file contains interfaces that allow clients to log Events to
// Cobalt.
//
// To use Cobalt, you must have a Project and one or more Metrics registered
// with the Cobalt registration system. You must also register one or more
// Reports in order to see the results of your logging aggregated over
// all Fuchsia devices. Registration of Projects, Metrics and Reports consists
// of entries in the YAML files in this repo:
// https://cobalt-analytics.googlesource.com/config/.
// In a Garnet checkout that is mapped to //third_party/cobalt_config.
// Each registered object has an integer ID and those IDs are used as
// parameters in the methods in this file.
//
// While Cobalt's code and registration files are open source, the running
// system being managed by the Cobalt team is currently intended to be used by
// software engineers at Google in order to collect metrics in a way that
// preserves our users' privacy. If you are a Google software engineer
// please see our internal [user guide](go/fuchsia-cobalt-userguide) or
// ask for assistance from the Cobalt [team](go/fuchsia-cobalt#comms).
//
// Usage: First use LoggerFactory to get a Logger for your
// project. Then you log Events using the Log*() methods.
// Events are accumulated by the cobalt FIDL service and periodically
// Observations, derived from the logged Events, are sent to the Cobalt server,
// where they are used to generate Reports.

// The maximum size of a single Event is 100 KB.
